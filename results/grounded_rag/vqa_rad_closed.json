He was referred to a cardiologist and a diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta was made. The rib notching was caused by dilated collateral intercostal arteries. Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. This narrowing can markedly reduce blood flow to the lower body. Many of the vessels above the narrowing therefore enlarge due to the increased pressure so that blood can reach the aorta below the level of the narrowing. Commonly, the internal thoracic, superior epigastric, and musculophrenic arteries enlarge anteriorly. These arteries supply the anterior intercostal arteries, which anastomose with the posterior intercostal arteries that allow blood to flow retrogradely into the aorta. Enlargement of the intertcostal vessels results in notching of the ribs.",

Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. This narrowing can markedly reduce blood flow to the lower body. Many of the vessels above the narrowing therefore enlarge due to the increased pressure so that blood can reach the aorta below the level of the narrowing. Commonly, the internal thoracic, superior epigastric, and musculophrenic arteries enlarge anteriorly. These arteries supply the anterior intercostal arteries, which anastomose with the posterior intercostal arteries that allow blood to flow retrogradely into the aorta.

The posterior cerebral artery (PCA) passes between the uncus and midbrain and may be occluded, leading to an occipital infarct. Masses higher up in the hemisphere can push the cingulate gyrus under the falx cerebri. This process is known as subfalcine herniation. The anterior cerebral artery (ACA) branches run along the medial surface",

Part of one lateral ventricle is often distorted, and both lateral and third ventricles may be displaced. Necrotic and sometimes cystic areas appear on imaging studies. An MRI series by Ulmer and colleagues showed that 70 percent of patients show evidence of a small region of restricted diffusion immediately surrounding the tumor in the postoperative period; it is likely that these regions may represent hypercellular tumor areas or ischemia that precedes necrosis.",

Even now some tumors reach enormous size, to the point of causing papilledema, before the patient comes to medical attention. Many are detected on CT in individuals with unrelated neurologic diseases. The diagnosis of meningioma is greatly facilitated by their ready visualization with contrast-enhanced CT and MRI (Figs. 30-7 and 30-8), which reveal their tendency to calcify as well as their prominent vascularity. These changes are reflected by homogeneous contrast enhancement and by \u201ctumor blush\u201d on angiography.

Pleural effusion is evident in 28\u201363% of patients on hospital admission.

Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. This narrowing can markedly reduce blood flow to the lower body. Many of the vessels above the narrowing therefore enlarge due to the increased pressure so that blood can reach the aorta below the level of the narrowing. Commonly, the internal thoracic, superior epigastric, and musculophrenic arteries enlarge anteriorly. These arteries supply the anterior intercostal arteries, which anastomose with the posterior intercostal arteries that allow blood to flow retrogradely into the aorta.

In the compensated region, increased volume is offset by decreased volume of CSF and blood.Increased ICP can injure the brain in several ways. Focal mass lesions cause shift and herniation. Temporal lesions push the uncus medially and compress the midbrain. This phenom-enon is known as uncal herniation. The posterior cerebral artery (PCA) passes between the uncus and midbrain and may be occluded, leading to an occipital infarct. Masses higher up in the hemisphere can push the cingulate gyrus under the falx cerebri. This process is known as subfalcine herniation. The anterior cerebral artery (ACA) branches run along the medial surface",

Many are detected on CT in individuals with unrelated neurologic diseases.

Three common pathological processes may occur in the pleural cavity. If air is introduced into the pleural cavity, a pneumothorax develops and the lung collapses because of its own elastic recoil. The pleural space fills with air, which may further compress the lung. Most patients with a collapsed lung are unlikely to have respiratory impairment. Under certain conditions, air may enter the pleural cavity at such a rate that it shifts and pushes the mediastinum to the opposite side of the chest. This is called tension pneumothorax and is potentially lethal, requiring urgent treatment by insertion of an intercostal tube to remove the air. The commonest causes of pneumothorax are rib fractures and positive pressure ventilation lung damage.",

Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. This narrowing can markedly reduce blood flow to the lower body. Many of the vessels above the narrowing therefore enlarge due to the increased pressure so that blood can reach the aorta below the level of the narrowing. Commonly, the internal thoracic, superior epigastric, and musculophrenic arteries enlarge anteriorly. These arteries supply the anterior intercostal arteries, which anastomose with the posterior intercostal arteries that allow blood to flow retrogradely into the aorta. Enlargement of the intertcostal vessels results in notching of the ribs.",

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?",

Some tumors may not be amenable to abla-tive therapies or partial nephrectomy, in which case radical nephrectomy would be employed.126Radical nephrectomy involves removal of the entire kidney with dissection external to Gerota\u2019s fascia. The colon is retracted medially after incising the white line of Toldt, fol-lowed by meticulous hilar dissection with ligation of the renal artery and vein. The adrenal gland is usually spared unless the tumor involves the gland or is immediately adjacent to it. Lymphadenectomy remains",

The patient was known to have a left renal cell carcinoma and was due to have this operated on the following week. Anatomically it is possible to link all of the findings with the renal cell carcinoma by knowing the biology of the tumor. Renal cell carcinoma tends to grow steadily and predictably. Typically, when the tumor is less than 3 to 4 cm, it remains confined to the kidney. Large tumors have the propensity to grow into the renal vein, the inferior vena cava and the right atrium and through the heart into the pulmonary artery.",

Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. This narrowing can markedly reduce blood flow to the lower body. Many of the vessels above the narrowing therefore enlarge due to the increased pressure so that blood can reach the aorta below the level of the narrowing. Commonly, the internal thoracic, superior epigastric, and musculophrenic arteries enlarge anteriorly. These arteries supply the anterior intercostal arteries, which anastomose with the posterior intercostal arteries that allow blood to flow retrogradely into the aorta.

Boys present between ages 5 and 15 years with academic difficulties, behavioral disturbances, and gait abnormalities, progressing to seizures, spasticity, ataxia, and swallowing difficulties. Brain MRI demonstrates a classic pattern of symmetric abnormal white matter signal in the parietal-occipital regions, with contrast enhancement at the anterior margin. Symptomatic adrenocortical insufficiency with fatigue, vomiting, and hypotension develops in 20% to 40% of patients with X-linked ALD. ALD should be considered in any male with primary adrenocortical",

From the clinical findings it was clear that the patient was likely to have a pneumonia confined to a lobe. Because there are only two lobes in the left lung, the likely diagnosis was a left upper lobe pneumonia. A chest radiograph was obtained (eFig. 3.121). The posteroanterior view of the chest demonstrated an area of veil-like opacification throughout the whole of the left lung. Knowing the position of the oblique fissure, any consolidation within the left upper lobe will produce this veil-like shadowing. Lateral radiographs are usually not necessary but would demonstrate opacification anteriorly and superiorly that ends abruptly at the oblique fissure. Upper lobe pneumonias are unusual because most patients develop gravity-dependent infection. Certain infections, however, are typical within the middle and upper lobes, commonly, tuberculosis (TB) and histoplasmosis.",

          "text": "Older reports of P. aeruginosa pneumonia described patients with an acute clinical syndrome of fever, chills, cough, and necrotizing pneumonia indistinguishable from other gram-negative bacterial pneumonias. The traditional accounts described a fulminant infection. Chest radiographs demonstrated bilateral pneumonia, often with nodular densities with or without cavities. This picture is now remarkably rare. Today, the typical patient is on a ventilator, has a slowly progressive infiltrate, and has been colonized with P. aeruginosa for days. While some cases may progress rapidly over 48\u201372 h, they are the exceptions. Nodular densities are not commonly seen. However, infiltrates may go on to necrosis. Necrotizing pneumonia has also been seen in the community (e.g., after inhalation of hot-tub water contaminated with P. aeruginosa). The typical patient has fever, leukocytosis, and purulent sputum, and the chest radiograph shows a new infiltrate or the expansion of a preexisting",
